# Movies App

A basic Movies Application which shows data fetched from API responses of an IMDb API. It shows details about the top 250 Movies and TV Shows as per the API response. The Application also has a feature to search for any Movie and TV Show the User wants to. It also gives the Users an option to Add/Remove their favourite Movies and TV Shows into their personalised Watchlist by just the press of a button! The Users can also change the theme of the Application to Light/Dark based on their Preferences.

The tool that has been used for State Management to build this application is GetX, becuase of the following advantages it has over the BLoc State Management:
 - The Stream Management is automated by the use of Controllers and Dependency Injections.
 - Has very efficient and easy to use State and Route Management tools.
 - Has many additional utilities for a better user experience, like the Snackbar implemented in the Application.
 - Much better RAM usage as compared to other State Management tools, resulting in an overall better Application Performance.
